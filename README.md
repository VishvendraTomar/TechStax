# Project Summary

The project is a web application that allows users to create workflows for basic data manipulation tasks in a visual and intuitive manner. Users can construct workflows by dragging and dropping pre-defined nodes onto a canvas, connecting them to define the flow of data processing.

4. **Workflow Reloading**: The application supports reloading previously saved workflows, enabling users to continue their work seamlessly.

## Workflow Creation

1. **Node Selection**: Users select nodes from a palette of available options, representing different data processing tasks.

2. **Node Configuration**: Users configure each node by specifying parameters and settings relevant to the task it represents.

3. **Connection Establishment**: Users establish connections between nodes to define the flow of data through the workflow.

4. **Workflow Preview**: Users can preview the workflow to visualize how data will flow through the defined sequence of tasks.

## Workflow Management

1. **Save Workflow**: Users can save the current state of their workflow to the system, providing them with the ability to revisit and edit it later.

2. **Reload Workflow**: Users can reload previously saved workflows from the system, allowing them to continue their work from where they left off.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: The frontend of the application is developed using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Reactflow.js for dynamic user interface elements.

- **Backend**: The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, providing the necessary APIs for workflow management and persistence.
